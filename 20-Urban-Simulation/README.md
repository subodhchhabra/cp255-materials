# Urban Simulation and Accessibility Modeling

### Overview:

Today we'll learn about the [Urban Data Science Toolkit (UDST)](https://github.com/udst), 
including [UrbanSim](https://github.com/UDST/urbansim) for urban simulation modeling and 
[Pandana](https://github.com/UDST/pandana) for network accessibility.

### Class Session:

Today we'll run through these slides and do a demonstration of urban simulation
using the [San Diego model](https://github.com/UDST/sandiego_urbansim) - follow
directions at link to download, install, and run through the simulation.
